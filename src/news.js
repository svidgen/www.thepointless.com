As you can plainly see, our last public update was a whopping **eight months ago** when we promised semi-fungible red dot tokens. "And where are they?" you ask.

		And boy, are you ever right to ask. But boy, do we ever have some answer.

		You see, it all started six months ago. We had millions of these virtual red dots just laying around, awaiting token fungitization. And we said, "Hey, let's fungitize these dots." But see, that's where things got hairy &mdash; really, literally hairy.

		For reasons unbeknownst to me, the dots started sprouting beard hairs. You can't even make this stuff up. They grew giant beards, formed a biker gang, and literally rode off. Red dots, which you normally expect to be doing literally nothing ([at least around here](/reddot)), grew beards, and rode into the freaking sunset.

		It was majestic. It was a little scary. And in the end, it's actually pretty infuriating. We had big plans for these dots, their tokenization, their fungitization, etc.. They were going to be famous. And now where are they?

		Freaking sunset. On motorcycles. Beards and everything.

		So, that's what we're up against here. Sure, there are still some dots around. But, not as many &mdash; what with all the dots in the sunset now with their beards. But, rest assured, we haven't forgotten about our promise. If push comes to shove, we'll see about coaxing them back with some sweet new rides or something. Or perhaps beard trimmers.

		In the meantime, sit tight. We'll get those fungible red dot tokens. We're just dealing with quite a lot of unexpected drama at the moment.

		Thanks for your patience.

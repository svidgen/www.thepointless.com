<div id='tos'>
<div>Welcome to our highly esteemed dot-com. By accessing thepointless.com you agree to adhere to the following terms. They’re just your typical terms of use. And so as usual, read them carefully or all your base are belong to us.</div>

<h5>PRIVACY</h5>
<div>We will use data we acquire from you for completely normal website purposes. This probably includes showing you ads that you will actually click on. Our possibly recording whether you clicked a button so we know if you liked the button. Things like that. We don't sell your data. But, we also use Google Ads and Google Analytics. They can do whatever they want with your data, I think. Refer to their privacy policies.</div>

<h5>COPYRIGHT</h5>
<div>All the stuff on this site belongs to us. Everything you publish here technically belongs to you, but by publishing anything here you grant thepointless.com royalty free license to use the content for all eternity.</div>

<h5>TRADEMARKS</h5>
<div>thepointless.com’s trademarks, favorite songs and poetry, favorite color, and anything else we feel embodies the spirit and mission our our website may not be used in connection with anything else in the world. Ever. (That's legally binding, right?)</div>

<h5>LICENSE AND SITE ACCESS</h5>
<div>You are licensed to see the stuff on this site for the duration of your visit. We are licensed to all the data you share with us for all eternity. Rough deal for you, but that's how it is.</div>

<h5>YOUR MEMBERSHIP ACCOUNT</h5>
<div>We are free to cancel your account whenever we want to and for whatever reason we want to.</div>

<h5>REVIEWS, COMMENTS, EMAILS, AND OTHER CONTENT</h5>
<div>You are free to send us communications or contribute content wherever contributions are permitted. In doing so, you grant us the right to use the submitted data and/or communications however we want for all eternity.</div>

<h5>RISK OF LOSS</h5>
<div>If you give us money, time, sweat, tears, or anything at all with the expectation of receiving anything in return which you then fail to receive, we take zero reponsibility. Seriously, we are not a serious shop, We're happy to take your money. Occasionally we'll return a good or service for it. But, we make no promises.</div>

<h5>INJURY FROM USE</h5>
<div>It is perfectly likely that you will be injured physically, spiritually, and emotionally during or because of your use of this site or its products. We are not responsible for any of your injuries, ever. And we <b>do</b> retain the right (bordering on <i>responsibility</i>) to laugh at you.</div>

<h5>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS</h5>
<div>By default, our products are essentially fictitious or digial "tokens" of ownership of imaginary products, because apparently, people like to own imaginary "things". (And to be clear, the "tokens" we offer aren't even guaranteed be secure or unique.) If we ever sell anything physical, we'll do our best to distinguish these products in some way as to make it clear they're physical products. But, this will probably never happen. We don't like to work. And as stated before, we are ultimately not responsible if the descriptions aren't clear enough for you.</div>

<h5>WARRANTY</h5>
<div>We do not provide any warranty on any thing or service, intellectual or otherwise. And, we actually reserve the right to intentionally include defects and self-destruct mechanism in all of our products and services. Because that's entirely what we're about. We are, in some ways, the emobodiment of internet defects. (And you're welome for that.)</div>

<h5>APPLICABLE LAW</h5>
<div>By visiting thepointless.com, you agree that the laws, bylaws, whims, and inclinations of thepointless.com, as maintained in the mind of its sole proprietor or dictator, will govern these terms of service and any disputes you may have with us and our products, services, policies, people, philosophies, associates, or other related entities of any kind.</div>

We reserve the right to change our terms whenever we want. If legal authorities decide that any portion of these terms or conditions is invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the invalid portion shall be deemed severable, and the remaining terms and conditions are still valid.</div>

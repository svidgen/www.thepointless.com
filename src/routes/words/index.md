Words come in all shapes and sizes. They say many different things. At times, you may find words herein that make no sense. When possible, I have tried to categorize these words so that you may less likely accuse me of being a loony.

Not that I'm *not* a loony. But, I do ask you to refrain from swinging such an accusation about *willy-nilly*. You might find such accusations smacking perfectly sane bystanders in the face. And we shan't have that. Shan we?

### [Serious words](./serious/index.html)
> You have been warned.

### [Silly words](./silly/shorts/index.html)
> Words like zabing and bazoot would be classified as such, amongst other words, like orangutan.

### [Unclassified words](./unclassified/index.html)
> These words may or may not be silly. (Like zebra.) And I prefer them to be ambiguous. (You can let me know if you think they're silly or serious on Twitter, if you like.)

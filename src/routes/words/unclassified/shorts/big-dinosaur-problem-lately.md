I have serious words for you, my mammals.

Dinosaurs are getting out of control. They have become vocal in traffic. They are STEGOSAUROUSLY impatient with fast food professionals, often to the point of speaking unkind words and **throwing** unfriendly glances. And don't even get me started on their completely REPTILLIAN and/or BIRDLIKE public demeanor.

On top of that, as per the photograph (above), these creatures:

1. Have no nostrils
1. Have no fingers
1. Have gills
1. Have pokey back things

Completely unacceptable. Spread the word. We must end this.

In an internet of darkness there shines forth a **light**.

Miscellaneous "bros" are busy trying to scam you out of your money with Web 3.0 and NFT crypto hax. We're just **M**aking W**E**b 1.0 **G**reat **A**gain.

### Just remember one thing.

## I will step on any house I choose.

</p>

It's part of the deal. But, we believe it is an acceptable compromise for greatness.

## In the meantime,

Our most popular bit of mindlessness was created *many moons* ago, and draws a
steady flow of traffic for reasons I cannot explain. Take a look.

### It's this ***[red dot](./reddot)***.

It's the best dot. We have the best dots. *Everybody says so.*

## Much more importantly,

We have created a *very handy* [**Frentagonist**](hs/frentagonist/) test. With it,
you can create a fancy looking profile *like this*:

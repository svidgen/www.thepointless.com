In an internet of darkness there shines forth a **light**.

***Or so we've been told.***

In the meantime, feel free to look around. **But remember:**

1. This is not your home; this is *my* home.
1. I do what I want; not what you want.
1. **I will step on any house I choose.**

And while the rest of the world is figuring out how to make Web3 work, we're
trying to figure out how *make Web 1.0 great again.*

## In the meantime,

Our most popular bit of mindlessness was created *many moons* ago, and draws a
steady flow of traffic for reasons I cannot explain. Take a look.

### It's this ***[red dot](./reddot)***.

It's the best dot. We have the best dots. *Everybody says so.*

## Much more importantly,

We have created a *very handy* [**Frentagonist**](hs/frentagonist/) test. With it,
you can create a fancy looking profile *like this*:

<pre class='clipped'>

See if we should 🍻 or ⚔️:

When your *so-called* friends and followers open it up, they can quickly see
whether you should plan to have drinks together **or ⚔️ *duel* ⚔️ 
at the break of dawn.** 🌅

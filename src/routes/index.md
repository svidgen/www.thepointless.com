In an internet of darkness there shines forth a **light**.

***Or so we've been told.***

In the meantime, you are less than welcome to hang around ~here~ *somewhere else probably*. Do not look in my fridge. Do not drink my beer. And please stay off my lawn.

This is not your home. It is my home. I do what I want.

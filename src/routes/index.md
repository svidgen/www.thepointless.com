In an internet of darkness there shines forth a **light**.

Miscellaneous "bros" are trying to scam you out of your money with Web 3.0 and NFT crypto hax. But, here we are, just **M**aking W**E**b 1.0 **G**reat **A**gain.

### Just remember one thing.

## I will step on any house I choose.

A regrettable part of the deal (for you). But, we believe it is an acceptable compromise for the return to greatness.

## Don't worry though.

We still have a ***[red dot](./reddot)***.

It's the best dot. (We have the best dots.) *Everybody says so.*

## Much more importantly,

We have created a *very handy* [**Frentagonist**](hs/frentagonist/) test. With it, you can create a fancy looking profile *like this*:

See if we should 🍻 or ⚔️:

When your *so-called* friends and followers open it up, they can quickly see
whether you should plan to have drinks together **or ⚔️ *duel* ⚔️ 
at the break of dawn.** 🌅

More to come. (Less to leave.)

Birds to flock. Sheep of a feather.
